# Lego-Star-Wars-Window-Stretcher

## What is this?
It's a simpel program that let's you play split-screen on two monitors in Star Wars The Skywalker Saga. The program changes the game resolution to whatever you choose and moves the window to the pixels you insert.

## How to run it
You can run it in two ways, either download the exe file and run it or compile the program yourself by downloading the source code.

Before running it you need to make sure your game is in Windowed Mode and Borderless

To run the program, use Command Prompt and use the following syntax 
```
LegoStarWarsWindowStretcher.exe {WIDTH} {HEIGHT} {xOffset}
```
An example if you use two 1920x1080 monitors would be 
```
LegoStarWarsWindowStretcher.exe 3840 1080 0
```
If you're going to use the same resolution each time you can make a bat-file with this command.
